# android-ctf-challenges
collection of android ctf challenges I've written for various CTFs.
Most challenges require basic reverse engineering or runtime manipulation.
Some challenges are no longer functional as they require a server to be running.

There are public writeups for most of these challenges on CTFtime or people's personal blogs for guidance.
